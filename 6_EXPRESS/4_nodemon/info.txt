Nodemon is a development module, that makes so you don't
have to manually restart the server everytime something
on the project files is changed.
Everytime a file is saved nodemon restarts the project for you,
making your life a little bit easier.

To use it:
'npm install --save-dev nodemon' to install it as a development module.
create a script in your project package.json like the following examples:
    "start": "nodemon <file> <server> <port>"
    "start": "nodemon ./index.js localhost 3000"
